\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 \ul \ulc0 Are the number of Chinooks increasing (in Calgary)?\
\

\b0 \ulnone If you live in Calgary, you\'92ve likely already read about Leonardo DiCaprio\'92s comments, but in case you haven\'92t, here it is:\

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 \'93We were in Calgary and the locals were saying, \'91This has never happened in our province ever.\'92 We would come and there would be eight feet of snow, and then all of a sudden a warm gust of wind would come.\cb1  \cb3 It was scary. I\'92ve never experienced something so firsthand that was so dramatic. You see the fragility of nature and how easily things can be completely transformed with just a few degrees difference. It\'92s terrifying, and it\'92s what people are talking about all over the world. And it\'92s simply just going to get worse.\'94\cb1 \
\

\i0 Now, if you live in Calgary (or have family that gloats!), you\'92ll recognize that he\'92s describing a Chinook, in particular, one from last year (2014) that made for January patio weather ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.calgaryherald.com/technology/Balmy+January+well+above+normal+average+temperature/9473459/story.html"}}{\fldrslt http://www.calgaryherald.com/technology/Balmy+January+well+above+normal+average+temperature/9473459/story.html}}) (it was awesome). \
\
You can probably imagine that Calgary, the NDP-voting, carbon taxing socialist haven was not super-thrilled by his comments\{{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://calgaryherald.com/storyline/that-awkward-moment-when-you-have-to-explain-a-chinook-to-leo-dicaprio"}}{\fldrslt http://calgaryherald.com/storyline/that-awkward-moment-when-you-have-to-explain-a-chinook-to-leo-dicaprio}}\}. Predictably, things got smug pretty quick ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/search?q=Chinook%20DiCaprio&src=typd"}}{\fldrslt https://twitter.com/search?q=Chinook%20DiCaprio&src=typd}}), and descended into, well\'85 \

Chinooks aren\'92t anything new to Calgary. Warm mid-winter winds almost certainly swept down the plains and melted all our snow long before we were burning coal. Southern Alberta even has a bunch of folklore centred around the Chinook, from Johnny Chinook ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh6HAcC70mI"}}{\fldrslt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh6HAcC70mI}}) to, well, this:\

\i \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 A man rode his horse to church, only to find just the steeple sticking out of the snow. So, he tied his horse to the steeple with the other horses, and went down the snow tunnel to attend services. When everybody emerged from the church, they found a Chinook had melted all of the snow, and their horses were now all dangling from the church steeple.\

\i0 Although they\'92ve been happening for a long time, this doesn\'92t necessarily mean they don\'92t have anything to do with climate change. Instead of ridicule an outsider, we can make something productive out his (simplistic) comments, and ask: \'93is it possible that there are more Chinooks now than before?\'94\
\

\b The Data:\

\b0 To test this, I grabbed Environment Canada daily weather data from Calgary Int\'92l A ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climateData/dailydata_e.html?timeframe=2&Prov=AB&StationID=2205&dlyRange=1881-10-01%7C2012-07-11&Year=1906&Month=10&cmdB1=Go&Day=1"}}{\fldrslt http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climateData/dailydata_e.html?timeframe=2&Prov=AB&StationID=2205&dlyRange=1881-10-01%7C2012-07-11&Year=1906&Month=10&cmdB1=Go&Day=1}}) for the period 1907 \'97 2012, using my sweet little web-scraper [insert link]. \
\
From my breakfast research, I couldn\'92t find any climate studies that had quantitative ways to define Chinooks, but there were a few health studies ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/33/7/1751.full"}}{\fldrslt

In the end, I ended up defining a Chinook as: \
\
- Occurs between November and March\
- The daily maximum temperature was greater than 5 C
\f0 \cf2 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 \
- The daily maximum temperature was 5 C greater than the day before.\
\
I then counted the number of occurrences for each year.\
\

\b Are there more Chinooks now than before?\
\

\b0 Yes. Turns out that from 1907 to 1960, there was a slight decrease in the number of Chinook days, but generally multi-year averages showed about 12 to 10 days a year. From 1960 on; however, there is a significant and steady increase in the number of Chinook days, rising from an average of 10 up to almost 15 days per year. The regression line from 1960 to 2012 was significant at >99% (statistics are really, really sure the line is a real signal, and not random variations), and projects about a doubling of number of Chinook days every 100 years. \

\
One weakness in this analysis is that the assumptions of defining a Chinook are hardly definitive, and could have impacted the results. To check this, I re-did the same analysis, using two other scenarios (max temperature of 2C and temperature difference of 7C, and max temperature of 8C and temperature difference of 5C). Both scenarios show pretty much the same thing as the \'935 and 5\'94 assumption above: the number of Chinooks decreased until 1960, but have increased since then. Additionally, however you slice it, there are more Chinook days now than before. \

\b Why would this happen and what does it have to do with climate change?
\b0  
\i \
\

\i0 To think about why this would happen (and what it could have to do with climate change), it helps to think about how and why a Chinook happens. Chinooks (also called Foehn) winds (which are not unique to southern Alberta) occur when wet gets carried eastward off the Pacific Ocean. The air, heavy with water vapour, gets pushed up the westward side of the Rocky Mountains and cools. As it cools, the water vapour condenses into rain droplets. When water vapour condenses to liquid, it releases a bunch of energy to the air, which turns into heat. By the time the airmass has reached the eastern edge of the Rockies, all the water has fallen out of the air (as rain/snow), but all the heat from condensation remains. Then, as the air descends over Calgary, it graces us with abnormally warm temperatures, and lots of dry (dry!) wind, eating all 8 ft of snow. \

Given that we in Calgary bask in sun while those suckers in Vancouver get pounded with a Pineapple Express ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineapple_Express"}}{\fldrslt https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineapple_Express}}), we can make the connection between coastal weather and Chinooks. Given that sea surface temperatures are increasing ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature#/media/File:Global_Sea_Surface_Temperature.jpg"}}{\fldrslt https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature#/media/File:Global_Sea_Surface_Temperature.jpg}}) (more water evaporates to atmosphere, more severe storms), while surface and air temperatures are as well (hotter air holds more moisture). Given that, it doesn\'92t feel like much of a stretch to suggest that the increase in Chinooks is likely due to an increase in We(s)t Coast storms intensity and frequency, and is therefore also one more bullet point in the long list of observed climate change. \
